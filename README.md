# Demo Catalog

This repository hosts a collection of demo stories. A demo story can be deployed with the [demo-deployer](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer).

## What is a demo story

A demo story is a set of services that are deployed to show off a particular common use case in a modern micro service architecture.  All demos are represented as a well defined JSON file that is then passed along to the [demo-deployer](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer).
